This is my attempt at using react with api's and fetch, it is based on another project I have done that is essentially the same, the only difference is the design (of which I did).

The app is not perfect, I still have to make a "word not found" page and figure out how to make the first of the precedurally generated input elements checcked by default, but for now I am very happy with the result and can't wait to practice more React and use more javascript frameworks.

Here is the design file: [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/1T8utWDs1wcLTVvAOWmDNw/Dictionary?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=2gOjV8Hnltod4Hqs-0).
